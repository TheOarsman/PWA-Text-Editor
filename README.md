## User Story

**AS A** developer <br>

**I WANT** to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection <br>

**SO THAT** I can reliably retrieve them for later use

## Acceptance Criteria

**GIVEN** a text editor web application

**WHEN** I open my application in my editor <br>
**THEN** I should see a client server folder structure

**WHEN** I run `npm run start` from the root directory <br>
**THEN** I find that my application should start up the backend and serve the client

**WHEN** I run the text editor application from my terminal <br>
**THEN** I find that my JavaScript files have been bundled using webpack

**WHEN** I run my webpack plugins <br>
**THEN** I find that I have a generated HTML file, service worker, and a manifest file

**WHEN** I use next-gen JavaScript in my application <br>
**THEN** I find that the text editor still functions in the browser without errors

**WHEN** I open the text editor <br>
**THEN** I find that IndexedDB has immediately created a database storage

**WHEN** I enter content and subsequently click off of the DOM window <br>
**THEN** I find that the content in the text editor has been saved with IndexedDB

**WHEN** I reopen the text editor after closing it <br>
**THEN** I find that the content in the text editor has been retrieved from our IndexedDB

**WHEN** I click on the Install button <br>
**THEN** I download my web application as an icon on my desktop

**WHEN** I load my web application <br>
**THEN** I should have a registered service worker using workbox

**WHEN** I register a service worker <br>
**THEN** I should have my static assets pre cached upon loading along with subsequent pages and static assets

**WHEN** I deploy to Render <br>
**THEN** I should have proper build scripts for a webpack application
